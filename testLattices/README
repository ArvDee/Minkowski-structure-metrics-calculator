These files can be used to test the output of the code.

Both the averaged and the non-averaged output Minkowski structure metrics should match the Steinhardt bond order parameters for the simple cubic (SC), face-centered cubic (FCC) and hexagonal close-packed (HCP) lattices, whose values are reported in Table 1 of Ref. [1]. The BCC will not match the Steinhardt case, as the definition of the neighbours differs between the two. Two reference values for the Minkowski structure metrics of the BCC lattice are reported in Ref 2, section IIc.

For each lattice there are 4 files that can be used: either a unit cell or a large lattice, and either in .dat or in .gsd format. All these should provide the same results.
